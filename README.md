| **Introduction**        | Creating a professional online presence is essential for showcasing projects. This guide outlines deploying an HTML website on GitHub Pages, a free static site hosting service by GitHub. |
| **Prerequisites**       | - A GitHub account (accessible at https://github.com)<br>- Basic HTML file (e.g., index.html) ready for upload<br>- Internet connection for repository management |
| **Step-by-Step Process** | 1. **Create a Repository**: Log into GitHub, click the "+" icon, select "New repository". Name it "<your-username>.github.io", add a README, and create it.<br>2. **Upload HTML File**: Navigate to the repository, click "Add file" > "Upload files", upload index.html, add a commit message, and commit.<br>3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to "Settings" > "Pages", set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch" with "main" branch and "/" folder, then save.<br>4. **Obtain Link**: After deployment (up to 10 minutes), find the URL (e.g., https://<your-username>.github.io) under "Pages" and test it.<br>5. **Verify and Update**: Check the site, edit the file on GitHub for updates, and commit changes for automatic redeployment. |
| **Additional Notes**    | - Site size limit is 1GB, with a 100GB monthly bandwidth cap.<br>- HTTPS is enabled by default for security.<br>- Custom domains are supported via DNS configuration (see GitHub documentation). |
| **Conclusion**          | Deploying on GitHub Pages offers a simple, cost-free solution for hosting static websites. Regular updates ensure content remains current. |
